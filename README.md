## My process

### Built with

- **HTML5** : For structuring the content.
- **Tailwind CSS** : For styling and creating responsive designs.
- **JavaScript** : Used to implement the mobile menu functionality.

### What I learned

During this project, I gained more familiarity with TailwindCSS utility classes and its responsive design capabilities. I also improved my ability to integrate dynamic functionality using JavaScript, such as toggling the mobile navigation menu.

Some key learnings include:

- Building responsive layouts using flex, grid, and TailwindCSS breakpoints.
- Creating interactive elements like buttons and navigation that adapt to user actions.
- Efficiently structuring HTML and TailwindCSS classes for cleaner and more maintainable code.

### Continued development

Future development of the homeSmart site will focus on:

- **Accessibility improvements** : Ensuring the website is fully accessible with screen readers and follows best practices for keyboard navigation.
- **SEO optimization** : Implementing meta tags, improving load times, and enhancing search engine visibility.
- **Advanced animations** : Using TailwindCSS's animation utilities or adding custom animations for a smoother and more interactive user experience.
- **Backend integration** : Linking the contact form to a backend server for handling form submissions and building out user authentication.
